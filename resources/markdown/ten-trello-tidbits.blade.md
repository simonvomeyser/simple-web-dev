I am receiving way to many E-mails with subjects like *Re: Re: Re: The logo should be more blue-ish* 

Since constantly facepalming is no way to live your life I tried tot of tools to improve communication. Comparing them should be the topic of another post, but [Trello](https://trello.com) is something you will definetely stumble across during a search like this.

In this post I want to mention a few things that the Trello Team does really well and with an incredible amount of focus on User Experience (UX).

I mean.. I regularly feel hugged by the trello UX team.. is that really just me?

<blockquote>
    Ten Trello Tidbits or Why Their UX Team Deserves a Hug
</blockquote>

Trello features a “Board has many Lists has many Cards” concept and therefore is really flexible, but no
unique snowflake. Cards can contain comments, media, descriptions, todo lists and due dates. Nothing fancy,
but it’s the details I want to draw your attention to.

<h2>The Batch create Card and Todo feature</h2>
One of the things I more or less noticed before reading about it is a what I would call a “batch create”
feature.

You can literally drop a bunch of text into the “Add todolist item” input field and Trello will create a new
item with every line break. Woha! The same thing works with the creation of cards, though you will be asked
beforehand. This is a feature that has recently landed in some todo applications (Check out <a
    href="https://todoist.com">Todoist</a> my app of choice) but Trello is the place I saw it first.

<h2>Intuitive keyboard navigation</h2>
I know that I am a little too much into shortcuts. I admit it. I spend hours learning shortcuts that will
maybe save me 5 Minutes a year. But the good thing about Trello’s keyboard navigation is: There is hardly
anything to learn. Want to navigate “Down” ? Press “Arrow Down”. Want navigate right? Do a handstand and
whistle “La Cucaracha” … no, just press “Right Arrow”.

I know this stuff sounds simple… but if it’s so simple why do most tools neglect that? Why can’t I
navigate my cards or tasks in other applications with the keyboard arrows and check todos or open an issue
detail view with Enter or Space? Okay, let’s be a little bit more helpful than grumpy:

<ul>
    <li>N New Card</li>
    <li>D Set Due Date</li>
    <li>E (Quick) Edit</li>
    <li>F to search a Card</li>
</ul>
Shortcuts can be so easy. Check Trellos <a href="https://trello.com/shortcuts">Shortcut Page</a> for more
info, you’ll might be surprised.

Since the whole point of this article is to mention this little UX gems: Pressing “Right Arrow” does not even
take you to the list right of you, but also to the corresponding card you were in the current list. I can’t
be the only one who finds this attention to detail impressive.

<h2>Notifications and fighting E-Mail SPAM</h2>
Most Applications either inform you too seldomly about important changes or bombard you with emails by
default. I have seen coworkers simple marking all emails coming from a tool as spam since it was too
complicated to find the settings in the app itself. At Trello, the team really has put a lot of thought into
their notification and email system to not make them loose significance by sheer mass.

There are three simple options for E-Mails:

<ul>
    <li>Send me E-Mails as fast as possible</li>
    <li>Send them once per Hour</li>
    <li>Don’t send me E-Mails at all</li>
</ul>
There are no “E-Mail Schemes”, no “call your admin to change this”, no nothing overly complex for normal
users to understand. And I know that some things seem obvious for somebody working in webdevelopment, but
nearly all projects involve other stakeholders without our background so the tool should be as easy to use
as humanly possible. Keep one thing in mind:

<blockquote>
    Even the most sophisticated tool will loose all it’s power when not understood and ignored by parts of
    the team.

</blockquote>
The emails are only send when you are “notified” inside of Trello. It is therefore worth to mention,
that the notification system absolutely makes sense. You’ll get notified if:

<ul>
    <li>You are mentioned</li>
    <li>You are watching a cards (issues) activity</li>
    <li>You are watching the whole board (project)</li>
</ul>
The notifications don’t jump into your face, they are hidden behind the “Bell Symbol” right next to your
accounts profile pitcture .

Think how much thought has been put into that, and now it looks so simple and obvious. That’s when you know a
system is good.

<h2>Flexibility and easy to learn for everyone</h2>
Needless to say, flexibility is one of the biggest strengths Trello has. The “Board List Card” principle can
be used to represent almost anything. Most commonly though, it is used in a <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)">Scrum</a> or <a
    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>-ish way, where the lists represent things like
“todo” “doing” or “backlog”.

I’ve also seen people use (and myself used) Trello for the wildest things. An example is using the lists for
every weekday and the cards for things they have to do. Another <a
    href="https://blog.hubspot.com/sales/personal-connections-template">example</a> is to create cards to organize the
people in your network to improve relationships with them or use Lists for every member of
your team to organize their todos.

The possibilities are <a href="https://trello.com/inspiration">endless</a>, and this is why I am a big fan of
advising teams during consulting sessions to (first) use trello, move fast, try things and find their very
own workflow. This is way more important than any tool, and Trello’s habit of not getting into your way
helps you immensely. After all:

<blockquote>
    When you find the right process, the tool you use will become insignificant.
</blockquote>

<h2>Create cards via E-Mail</h2>
A nice feature is the fact, that every board comes with a dedicated email address. When you are poor person
in charge of client communication, you can simply send a task from a conversation to a board. From there
your team internal workflow should pick up.

You can find the feature under the Menu on the right and then clicking the “more” link and then
“Email-to-board-settings”.

And even if I repeat myself: I am not saying this feature is perfect, it becomes quite confusing at times to
have a long blob of text in there. I am just saying that the idea is really good and it is cool how
much energy and thought has been put into things like this.

<h2>Speed &amp; Background Saves</h2>
There is not even the slightest indicator of loading time. I’ve worked with the <a href="https://developers.trello.com/"
    target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Trello REST
    API</a> and I know that it is not the fasted interface ever invented. What I am trying to stress
here is, that the <strong>perceived performance </strong>is incredible. When on a board, you almost
don’t notice that your actions are saved in the background.

Even if you don’t save your changes, drafts of comments or cards will be persisted so you don’t loose
something accidentally. This approach can be found in many apps, but Trello gives me the most confidence
that my changes will still be there.

<h2>Smartphone Apps</h2>
The UX of Smartphone Apps is a whole world of their own and I will not cover anything about it here. I simply
want to mention, that I (as an user of the Android App) was absolutely happy with it. It’s even
<strong>partly possible to work offline</strong> when you opened a board before and changes will be merged
later. I must say, that I found the notifications a little annoying but that could be my personal
preference since I tend to disable all notifications on my phone.

<h2>Search and filter cards like a pro</h2>
Something I grown to like more and more over the last month is the awesome search function. As a Developer, I
love <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_string_matching"><em>fuzzy
        search</em></a> working to different degrees in most text editors or IDEs. You just type
something you know is contained in the File or Command you want, and voilà, the thing you look for and
the closest other matches are found.

The Trello team must have put some serious effort into their own search and filter function because it works
quite similar. You can type words that are contained in a card, regardless of their order, case and board
they are on. There is direct feedback that pops up, so you don’t have to push a button and wait just to
notice, that you spelled something wrong.

There are special commands you can use, all of them documented <a
    href="https://help.trello.com/article/808-searching-for-cards-all-boards">here.</a> As an example,
you can use @me to only show cards assigned to you.

The last awesome thing to mention is the fact, that you can even chain things like a search phrase, the name
of a board and the command to show only cards assigned to you. Combine this with keyboard shortcuts, and you
have a cool workflow to find relevant cards.

It’s worth to mention, that <em>search </em>is intended for a search across all
boards, <em>filtering </em>works only in the current board. A point of critique would be, that you
can’t use command like @me in the filter context. Nonetheless, the documentation is spot on, right beneath
the search of filter function all possibilities are explained.

<h2>Integrations and powerups</h2>

To be frank I did not use too many Powerups since the tool already has so many things baked in. But there is
a plethora (fancy word that makes me look smart) of things you can add to a board to add functionality
you might miss. A prominent example is a calendar to show all your due dates, but there is so much more. I
recently used a <a href="https://info.trello.com/power-ups/card-aging">Powerup that indicated the <em>age
    </em>of cards</a> by making them more transparent when there was no activity for a longer period.
You also can integrate almost any service, add custom fields, repeat actions <a href="https://trello.com/power-ups">and
    so much more</a>.

<h2>It’s the little things</h2>
There are so much more little features that make me smile every day and that are the main reason I wrote this
article.

You can drag the avatars of the boards members onto cards

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1529040916/Trello/Kapture_2018-06-15_at_7.29.36.gif">

You can start writing the title of a new card in one list, and then finish it in another

<img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1529041166/Trello/Kapture_2018-06-15_at_7.39.14.gif">

Use things like @name, #label or ^position while creating cards to assign people, labels or position a card
during creation. Details are at the bottom of the <a href="https://trello.com/shortcuts">shortcuts page</a>.

The color of your board or the choosen background will by shown as favicon in your browser tab for
orientation

You can use stickers and attach them to cards to make everything more colorful

And just to utter a little critique: How to alter or remove stickers is something, the UX team (in my
opinion) has not found the perfect solution for. Here is how 🙂

<h2>Last words</h2>
That’s a lot right? And just to be clear, I am not saying trello is the best tool for every purpose in
project management. But most tools, while clearly having advantages for certain use cases, lack these
simple features I would consider immensely helpful. Why isn’t my todolist app able to keyboard navigate, why
is the project managend tool at a company I work for not auto saving my comments draft when I am
accidentally hit the escape key? And why am I trying to apologize to people who will get angry no matter
what because their grandma programmed JIRA?

I am just trying to be helpful and have a little fun. Let’s all be friends and hug each other more often,
like the Trello UX team does with it’s users.
