    A few thoughts on the ever more unclear destinction beteween "frontend", "backend" and "full stack" developers 

    When are you allowed to call yourself what? Why you maybe should be more self confident, but also not too lazy to look beyond your field of intrest.

What's a good job title for me, what do I want to do - and am I already *allowed* to call myself "Ninja Master Webwizard of Doom"™️? No matter if you are working as a freelancer or as an employee, you might ask yourself this question at some point at your career.

I just want to ramble a little about my thoughts on this topic, because what does something like "Full Stack" even mean, are you selling yourself short – or are you resting inside your comfort zone?

We (web) developers are usually prone to fall victim to the [Imposter Syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impostor_syndrome), doubting our skills and being afraid of not knowing "enough" about something. But what we constantly need to remind ourselves of is, that you'll **never** know enough. Simply put:

> The more you know, the more you know what you don't know

Relax, knowing how much you don't know can also be a sign, that you have matured in your career. If you ever heard of the "Dunning Kruger Effect" you realize, this at least shows, that you are not a totally oblivious about the complexity of your field anymore.

But okay, what does this have to do with job titles? 

## frontend, backend, fullstack? backstack & fullend!

I personally think, that the hard distinction between frontend and backend is quite antiquated, since things get easier on both ends of the *spectrum*. 
If you don't like design and CSS that much, [Tailwind UI](https://tailwindui.com/) and [Apline Components](https://alpinejs.dev/components) can take you a long way. 
If you feel less at home in the world of servers and databases There are things like [Laravel Forge](https://forge.laravel.com) and [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com/) to ease your pain. Even outside of he Laravel ecosystem, there are even full-on solutions like a CaaS (CMS as a Service, or Dutch for 🧀), for example (Sanity)[https://www.sanity.io/api-cms].

So you see it's quite easy nowadays to stay in your comfort-zone but still implement complete (i.e. "full stack") services. 

## But what does it mean?

The point I am trying to get to, is that we should stop thinking in these narrow categories or boxes. 

> Your job is a spectrum, not a narrow box

I really like to think about our job as a spectrum reaching from artsy fartsy design to Assembler. An example would be somebody really into servers, configurations, backend API Design code, but with little to no interest in HTML, CSS and JavaScript

I personally like design and visual things a litte more, but I am by no means a Designer nor really interested in branding.

## So, jack of all trades, master of none?

I beg to differ here: In my opinion, and to some extent, we need to look "über den Tellerand" as we say in Germany - essentially look beyond your nose. 

Even if you specialize, knowing a good deal about the other area makes you even *better*. Backend devs should write some CSS and maybe know at least in theory, what the implications of the weird frontend state management library is. This fosters mutual understanding, and creates a better product in the end.

> Okay, Specialize... but interdisciplinary knowledge can be really valuable


- The spectrum, from artsy fartsy to configuring kubernetes aws clusters
- Almost every developers nowadays is most likely a "Full Stack Developer", for most more senior job, it is at least expected, that you can setup a server and launch a website, even if you specialize only in froneted work
- Don't let yourself get away that easy. You can specialize, but knowing a thing or two about Frontend will benefit you immensly in API Design, 
- I like to call myself "web wizard" or senõr web developer just to mock it.


## Conclusion

I really like the term "web developer" because it's not 
Nobody is fully a frontend developer, or a backend engineer if you work in the web.


# Notes

((What are we talking? Big apps small apps, Facebook size?))
-> People who really call themselves "Frontend Developer" convey two 
-> thinking in terms of frontend and backend devs fosters silo-ing your dev team
-> Or are you not willing to look a little bit outside of your comfort zone
-> Things are easier nowadays, but also way more connected and complex
