Warning, this article might contain some rambling about non code related stuff!

I strongly believe in the fact, that all developers are only as good as their teams. In this article I want to talk a little about why I think *keeping your design in the cloud* is a low hanging fruit for team productivity - in every project that includes some stakeholder other than you. 


We developers seem to have a proclivity for closed curtains, dimmed the light and entering the Matrix while  avoiding distractions from the outside worlds. I admit, I really enjoy it sometimes. But almost all projects that are not only for your personal use involve people we need to talk to.

As much as concentrated, uninterrupted boxes of deep work (??? add link) improve your work, there is no benefit in coding a feature in record breaking time just to notice that  


I really love the quote from ???:

> Trust your coworkers, you do not scale

That said, it is also true, that communication poses other hurdles: Most time a "unit of work" spends in a system (??? add link to kanban) is in the dreadful stages "blocked", "awaiting review" or "Joe is on fishing vacation"

Every tool or workflow that therefore improves blockages or inefficient workflows should be greeted with applause and drowned in roses.

One really inefficient workflow we all were guilty of is copying a file, adding something to it's end and spreading that thing like a metaphor that will get me in trouble.

The problem is so ubiquitous that it has become a meme:

??? add image of final fucking final psd

I don't want to talk about the fact that still of load of .final.docx files are passed around, that's a battle of its own. As a web developer doing a lot of frontend work but working together with designers my google mail history is filled with `mobile.final-rev2.less-blue.jpg` files.

This workflow is not only annoying and timeconsuming, it also leads to a less ideal product.

> When the cost of communication is high, people stop to ask

This might be tempting situation with an annoying customer - but it leads to less questions and therefore a project where the developer misunderstood what the designer tried to paint what the customer could not put into words.

?? maybe add image of what the customer wanted

Luckily there are now services that improve that workflow and which are almost a "must use" for teams:

## Design in the cloud

I first came across this concept when I noticed that 

- List first thing with bitmade
- Talk about sketch
- Talk about sketch cloud
- Talk about Adbobe XD
- Talk about: The Idea is not new
- Talk about clanky wireframe tools
- Talk about: Enter Figma

## Why Figma stole my heart

- Ease of use
- Perf (browser)
- copy paste
- FREE
- Features
- Humor, Social Media and community: show tweet 

## Bottom line

Use these tools, they are free, the benefits are immense!
