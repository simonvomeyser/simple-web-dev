Warning, this article might contain some rambling about non code related stuff!

I strongly believe in the fact, that all developers are only as good as their teams. In this article I want to talk a little about why I think *keeping your design in the cloud* is a low hanging fruit for team productivity - in every project that includes some stakeholder other than you. 

We developers seem to have a proclivity for closed curtains, dimmed light and entering the Matrix while avoiding distractions. But almost all projects that are not only for your personal use involve people we need to talk to.

As much as concentrated, uninterrupted boxes of deep work (??? add link) improve your work, there is no benefit in coding a feature in record-breaking time just to notice it's not what the customer or your team needed.  

I really love the quote from ???:

> Trust your coworkers, you do not scale

That said, it is also true, that communication poses other hurdles: Most time a "unit of work" spends in a system (??? add link to kanban) is in the dreadful stages "blocked", "awaiting review" or "Joe is on fishing vacation"

---------------------------(??? maybe omit the upper part) -------------------------------

As a web developer doing a lot of teamwork with designers my email history contains a lot `mobile.final-rev2.less-blue.jpg` files - and I am as guilty of this pile of shame as the designers are.

The problem is so ubiquitous it has become a meme:

??? add image of final fucking final psd

But what can you do about that? 

But I came to the conclusion, that improving this workflow not only only has a positive influence on my very own porductivity, the whole project and end product will be a lot better.

> When the cost of communication is high, people stop to ask

This might be tempting situation with an annoying customer - but it leads to fewer questions and therefore a project where the developer misunderstood what the designer thought the customer said.

?? maybe add image of what the customer wanted

Luckily there are more and more services trying to tackle that problem by facilitating communication through a cloud based approach.  

## Design in the cloud

Instead of sending around the next version of the file it is kept in a central location - ideally with all its revisions, iterations and comments. 

There are a few things that are important here:

- How well can non-technical people access the Design and give feedback
- How similar are the tools to what the Designer is used to, great switching cost
- 

I first came across this concept when I noticed that 

- List first thing with bitmade
- Talk about sketch
- Talk about sketch cloud
- Talk about Adbobe XD
- Talk about: The Idea is not new
- Talk about clanky wireframe tools
- Talk about: Enter Figma

## Why Figma stole my heart

- Ease of use
- Perf (browser)
- copy paste
- FREE
- Features
- Humor, Social Media and community: show tweet 

## Bottom line

Use these tools, they are free, the benefits are immense!
