title: Teams should design in the cloud... or why Figma stole my heart
release_date: today

  I strongly believe that all developers are only as good as their teams. 

  In this article I want to talk and get a little meta about why I think design in the cloud is a low hanging fruit for team productivity.

As a web developer doing a lot of teamwork with designers my email inbox contains many `mobile-rev2_less-blue.final.jpg` files - and I am as guilty of this workflow as the designers are.

The problem is so ubiquitous it has become a meme... and an accessory

But what can you do about that? Why should we developers care? 

The answer is quite simple: Because our goal as nerds should always be to create better product, and that does not only include improving our own workflow by learning that next keyboard shortcut.

Design in the cloud has really become a *low hanging fruit* in terms of improving your internal workflow as well as your customer-facing communication. 

I always try to remember the following:

> When the cost of communication is high, people stop to ask questions

This might be tempting situation with an annoying customer - but it leads to fewer solved problems and therefore a project where the developer misunderstood what the designer thought the customer wanted.

Luckily there are more and more services trying to tackle one part of that problem with a cloud based approach. 

I want to show a few of these approaches here... and maybe toss a few roses in [https://www.figma.com/](Figma's) direction, but that's just a personal thing. ðŸŒ¹ 

## My perspective

From a developer's point of view I've seen designers use all sorts of funky tools for web design. Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator and even InDesign. 

In almost all cases the design was awesome and something I would have never been able to do... well, for two reasons:

On the one hand because I am not that talented, but on the other hand I simply did not own paid licenses to the products above. (I own one for Photoshop to glue my head on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body though) 

(???Add arnold image)

Erm... back to the topic. I hope you see the workflow problem when a developer cannot reliably open the designer's file to export images or to look up spacings, fonts or colors. 

It simply adds way too much overhead to communication, including the back and forth between the designer and the client. 

> Which file was the latest version again ... and where are the comments?

Instead of sending around the next version it is therefore clearly better to keep the design in a central location - theee clouuudd

## What are (some of the) tools

There are many awesome tools on the market by now. I can't do all of them the justice, but I want to give a quick overview about the options I know of:

### Adobe XD

![Logo of Adobe XD](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/adobexd.png)

I am really happy that Adobe entered the ring! It helps to get the adoption going because many designers are used to the companies' products.  

It offers many features for collaboration like sending links where non tech-savvy people can simple watch the design and give feedback without the hassle of installing an app or finding an exported image in their email inbox. 

The best thing is that it is free, so developers can install it, open the current, cloud synced file and copy color values or export assets. 

I had a few problems here since it does not play *that* nicely with SVGs or Icons and I think to make an asset exportable there is a little work involved. Other than that I only had good experiences with it.

### Invison

![Invision Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/invision.png)

Invision App is the first tool I came across where you could upload your screen design from Sketch or Photoshop, then send a link to anyone and discuss or demo your project.

While the idea was great at that time, I really found it a bit complicated to use as a developer, also there was the constant need for the designer to re-upload their work after changes, hardly any way to export and so on.

After researching them for this article I noticed they introduced their own screen design app called [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) to be not bound to these limitations. 

This app seems to be fairly full featured, but you'll need a subscription plan to use it with more than one project.

![Pricing plan of Invision](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1592319566/design-in-the-cloud/Untitled.png)

I found their discussion tools to be one of the best on the marked, and at least you can try their services for free :)

### Sketch Cloud

![Sketch Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/sketch.png)

For quite some time Sketch seemed to be the big competitor for Adobe products and was even announced as "Photoshop Killer"... just like too little RAM.

While I liked to use Sketch in the beginning I am not so happy with their pricing model anymore. I stopped using it since I bought a "lifetime license" but suddenly had to pay for updates again and can't open files saved with newer versions :/

One might say they pulled a "Microsoft Word" - move

![Sketch's pricing, noting the one year period](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/sketch-pricing.png)

The reason I list Sketch here is that they [announced](https://www.sketch.com/docs/sketch-cloud/) a cloud solution recently, and I used it with a team I was working with.
 
I could not open the files anymore, but I could looked at online, but I must say I was not really happy with it. We did not find a way to export assets or to make view color codes visible. 

Maybe I was just not smart enough, or they updated the [inspector](https://www.sketch.com/docs/sketch-cloud/#cloud-inspector-beta) by now, in this case I'll apologize.

I think this is not the best solution to improve your team's productivity, still a damn good app though.

### Other tools

There are so many other awesome tools that often do serve the purpose of wire framing or brainstorming.
 
Some of them seem intentionally created to be a little less colorful and can serve your needs quite well. I tried [moqups.com/](https://moqups.com/) and was quite happy, but there are [many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+wireframe+tool) with different pricing models and capabilities. 

## Why Figma stole my heart

![Logo of Figma](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/Figma.png)

I omitted Figma in the list above because I wanted to talk a little more in depth about this app.

![Meme of Figma sales pitch](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016374/design-in-the-cloud/a-moment.png)

I more or less stumbled across their app two years ago and must say to this day I am impressed as well as intimidated by its performance and usability. 

We could talk a lot about single features and compare them, but the most important thing to me is the fact, that Figma facilitates teamwork just a bit better than other apps.

The team really put some thought on what is in my opinion the most important thing for a successful product: 

> It speeds up the whole team, not only parts of it

I can only speak from a developer's perspective here, but I love that you can export anything, choose your own file format, upload any size of image, copy CSS values, almost never have missing fonts or compatibility problems, since the app works on all platforms.

They have a really generous free tier, and you only pay for more advanced features like  really granular permissions, more than 30 days of version history and so on.

Also, their name sounds quite dirty in German, and they have humor:

![Tweet Screenshot - Figma's name sounds dirty in German](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593018072/design-in-the-cloud/figma-dirty.png)

If I had two criticize something it would be tiny things like the fact, that you can easily send links to non-technical people to view the design, but to comment they have to create a account. 

This is a small hurdle since a stakeholder does not necessarily want to have an account (and that most of them always seem to forget their passwords ðŸ˜…). Adobe XD offers an anonymous comment feature by the way.

Also, the design team has to get used to a completely different tool, something that could be a big deal depending on how specialized the designers are.

All in all I still think Figma is the best choice in most cases, but we developers will need to have this conversation with a lot of empathy - just imagine you had to switch your beloved code editor to improve the whole team.

## Bottom line

Our developer guild has a unique way of looking at workflows, and we tend to get itchy a little faster when we see constant repetition. 

Some designers or product managers often don't see this kind of problems so why don't we add our perspective in the next team meeting or retrospective. Just suggest a cloud based design and review workflow.

No matter which cloud design tool your team decides to use - you will most definitely create a better workflow and have more time for what really matters: Creating an awesome product. :)
