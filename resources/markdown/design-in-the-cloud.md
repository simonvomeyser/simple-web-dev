  I strongly believe that all developers are only as good as their teams. 

  In this article I want to talk a little meta about why I think design in the cloud is a low hanging fruit for team productivity, and why every developer should care.

As a web developer doing a lot of team project my email inbox contains lots of `mobile-rev2_less-blue.final.jpg` files - and I am as guilty of this workflow as the designers are.

The problem is so ubiquitous it has become a meme... and an accessory:

![Images of Photoshop Files called final.final.psd](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016372/design-in-the-cloud/f-in-final.png)

But what can you do about that? Why should especially we as developers care? 

The answer is quite simple: Because our end goal should always be to create better product, and that's not solely achieved by learning a new keyboard shortcut or adding a smart abstraction.

Design in the cloud has really become a *low hanging fruit* to improve your team workflow as well as your customer communication. 

I always try to remember the following:

> When the cost of communication is high, people simply stop to ask questions

This might be tempting situation with an annoying customer - but it leads to fewer solved problems and therefore a project where the developer misunderstood what the designer thought the customer wanted.

![Image of failed communication, the customer wanted a swing, the developer created a helicopter](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593017502/design-in-the-cloud/what-the-customer.png)

Luckily there are more and more services trying to tackle one part of that problem with a cloud based approach. 

I want to show a few of these approaches here... and maybe toss a few roses in [Figma's](https://www.figma.com/) direction, but that's just a personal thing. ðŸŒ¹ 

## My perspective

From a developer's point of view I've seen designers use all sorts of funky tools for web design. Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator and even InDesign. 

In almost all cases the design was awesome and something I would have never been able to do... well, for two reasons:

On the one hand because I am not that talented, but on the other hand I simply did not own paid licenses to the products above. (I own one for Photoshop to glue my head on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body though)

Erm... back to the topic. I hope you see the workflow problem when a frontend developer cannot access the designer's files to for example export images or to look up spacings, fonts or colors. 

The alternative in most cases is sending around exported files between all stakeholders. I think this workflow simply adds way too much overhead to communication. 

> Which file was the latest version again ... and where are the comments?

It is therefore clearly better to keep the design and discussions in a central, always updated location everybody can access - theee clouuuud.

## What are (some) tools

There are so many full featured tools on the market by now, and I surely can't do all of them justice.

I only want to give a quick overview about the options I know of with a focus of improving team productivity, and with the narrow view of a developer not able to draw unicorns that well.

### Invison

![Invision Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593533534/design-in-the-cloud/invision.png)

[Invision App](https://www.invisionapp.com/) is the first tool I came across where you could upload your screen design from Sketch or Photoshop, then send a link to anyone and discuss or demo your project.

While the idea was great at that time, I really found it a bit complicated to use as a developer, also there was the constant need for the designer to re-upload their work after changes, hardly any way to export and so on.

After researching them for this article I noticed they introduced their own screen design app called [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) to not be bound to these limitations. 

The app seems to be fairly full featured, but you'll need a subscription plan to use it with more than one project.

![Pricing plan of Invision](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1592319566/design-in-the-cloud/Untitled.png)

I found their discussion tools to be one of the best on the marked, and you can try their services for free.

Why not try them if your team wants to stick with their tools.


### Adobe XD

![Logo of Adobe XD](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593533327/design-in-the-cloud/adobexd.png)

I am really happy Adobe entered the ring of cloud based screen design tools! It helps to get the adoption going because many designers are used to Adobe's products like Photoshop and Illustrator.  

[Adobe XD](https://www.adobe.com/products/xd.html) specialized in screen design and offers many features for collaboration. You can send links to a stakeholder to simply watch the design and give feedback without the hassle of installing an app. 

The best thing is that it is **completely** free, so all developers can install it, open the current, cloud synced file and copy color values or export assets. 

I had a few problems here since it does not play *that* nicely with SVGs or Icons and I think to make an asset exportable there is a little work involved.

Other than that I only had good experiences with it. Adobe XD really is a good tool to improve your teamwork.


### Sketch Cloud

![Sketch Logo](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593533534/design-in-the-cloud/sketch.png)

For quite some time [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/) seemed to be the big competitor for Adobe products and was even announced as "Photoshop Killer"... just like too little RAM.

While I liked to use Sketch in the beginning I am not so happy with their pricing model anymore. I stopped using it since I bought a *lifetime license* but suddenly had to pay for updates again and can't open files saved with newer versions ðŸ¤¨

One might say they pulled a "docx" - move.

![Sketch's pricing, noting the one year period](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016371/design-in-the-cloud/sketch-pricing.png)

The reason I list Sketch here is that they [announced](https://www.sketch.com/docs/sketch-cloud/) a cloud solution recently, and I used it in a team I was working with.
 
Since I could not open the designer's files anymore I used the link to the cloud version. Sadly I must say that I was not really happy with it. We did not find a way to make assets exportable or to view color codes with ease. 

Maybe I was just not smart enough, or they updated the [inspector](https://www.sketch.com/docs/sketch-cloud/#cloud-inspector-beta) by now, in this case I'll apologize.

I think their Cloud is not the best solution to improve your team's productivity to be honest. Sketch is still a damn good app though.

### Other tools

There are so many other awesome tools that often do serve the purpose of wire framing or brainstorming.
 
Some of them seem intentionally created to be a little less colorful and can serve your needs quite well. I tried [moqups.com/](https://moqups.com/) and was quite happy, but there are [many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+wireframe+tool) with different pricing models and capabilities. 

## Why Figma stole my heart

![Logo of Figma](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593533327/design-in-the-cloud/Figma.png)

I omitted Figma in the list above because I wanted to talk a little more in depth about this app.

![Meme of Figma sales pitch](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593016374/design-in-the-cloud/a-moment.png)

I more or less stumbled across their app two years ago and must say to this day I am impressed as well as intimidated by its performance and usability. 

We could talk a lot about single features and compare them, but the most important thing to me is the fact, that Figma facilitates teamwork just a bit better than other apps.

The team really put some thought in what is in my opinion the most important for a successful product: 

> It speeds up the whole team, not only parts of it

I can only speak from a developer's perspective here, but I love that you can export anything and even choose the  image file type or size. You can simply upload any size of image, even copy and paste SVG codes with ease.
 
Accessing CSS values and spacing is also really easy, and I almost never have missing fonts or compatibility problems since they integrate directly with google fonts, and the Electron app works on all platforms.
 
They have a really generous free tier, and you only pay for more advanced features like really granular permissions, more than 30 days of version history and so on.

Also, their name sounds quite dirty in German - hey, they are humorous about it:

![Tweet Screenshot - Figma's name sounds dirty in German](https://res.cloudinary.com/simonvomeyser/image/upload/v1593018072/design-in-the-cloud/figma-dirty.png)

If I had two criticize something it would be tiny things like the fact, that you can of course easily send links to non-technical people to view the design, but to comment they have to create an account. 

This is a small hurdle, but in my experience a non tech stakeholder does not necessarily want to have an account - and most of them always forget their passwords ðŸ˜…. 

Adobe XD offers this anonymous comment feature, just to be fair here.

I'd also have to mention, that the design team has to get used to a completely different tool. This could be a big deal depending on how specialized the designers are.

All in all I still think Figma is the best choice in most cases. 

we developers will need to have this conversation with a lot of empathy though - just imagine you had to sacrifice your beloved code editor to improve the whole team.

## Bottom line

Our developer guild has a unique way of looking at things, and we tend to get itchy a little faster when we see inefficient things. We should use our perspective to improve the very workflows that annoy us - instead of joking about the next confused email. 

Some designers, managers or customers just don't see this special kind of problems as we do - why don't talk about it in the next team meeting or retrospective.

No matter which cloud design tool your team then decides to use - you will most definitely create a better workflow, better demos, and have more time for what really matters: Creating an awesome product. :)
