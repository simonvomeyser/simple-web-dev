Warning, this article might contain some rambling about non code related stuff!

I strongly believe in the fact, that all developers are only as good as their teams. In this article I want to talk a little about why I think *keeping your design in the cloud* is a low hanging fruit for team productivity - in every project that includes some stakeholder other than you. 

We developers seem to have a proclivity for closed curtains, dimmed light and entering the Matrix while avoiding distractions. But almost all projects that are not only for your personal use involve people we need to talk to.

As much as concentrated, uninterrupted boxes of deep work (??? add link) improve your work, there is no benefit in coding a feature in record-breaking time just to notice it's not what the customer or your team needed.  

I really love the quote from ???:

> Trust your coworkers, you do not scale

That said, it is also true, that communication poses other hurdles: Most time a "unit of work" spends in a system (??? add link to kanban) is in the dreadful stages "blocked", "awaiting review" or "Joe is on fishing vacation"

---------------------------(??? maybe omit the upper part) -------------------------------

As a web developer doing a lot of teamwork with designers my email history contains a lot `mobile.final-rev2.less-blue.jpg` files - and I am as guilty of this pile of shame as the designers are.

The problem is so ubiquitous it has become a meme... and an accessory

??? add image of final fucking final psd, maybe keyring?

But what can you do about that? Why should we developers care? 

The answer is quite simple: Because our goal as nerds should always be to create better product, and that does not only include improving our own workflow by learning that next keyboard shortcut.

Design in the cloud has really become a *low hanging fruit* in terms of improving your internal workflow as well as your customer-facing communication. It will not only have a positive influence on productivity, the whole project and end product will be a lot better.

I always try to remember the following:

> When the cost of communication is high, people simply stop to ask

This might be tempting situation with an annoying customer - but it leads to fewer solved problems and therefore a project where the developer misunderstood what the designer thought the customer meant.

Luckily there are more and more services trying to tackle that problem with a cloud based approach. I want to show a few of them here from a developer perspective... and maybe toss a few roses in [https://www.figma.com/](Figma's) direction, but that's just a personal thing. ðŸŒ¹ 

## My perspective

From a developer's perspective I've seen designers use all sorts of funky tools for web design. Photoshop, Sketch, Illustrator and even InDesign. In almost all cases the design was awesome and something I would have never been able to do... well, for two reasons:

On the one hand because I am not that talented, but on the other hand because I did not own paid licenses to the products above. (I own one for Photoshop to glue my head on Arnold Schwarzenegger's body though) 

(???Add arnold image)

Erm... never mind. But I hope you see the problem when a developer cannot open the designer's file to export images or to simply look up spacings and colors. It simply adds way too much overhead to communication, including the back and forth between the designer and the client. 

*Which `.png` file was the latest version again? In which Word document did you put your remarks?*

Instead of sending around the next version it is therefore clearly better to keep the design in a central location - theee clouuudd

## What are (some of the) tools

There are many awesome tools that came out of the woodwork in the last years. I can't do all of them the justice, but I want to give a quick overview about the options I know of:

### Adobe XD

?? add logo

I am really happy to see Adobe enter the ring with this! It helps to get the adoption going because many designers are used to the companies' products.  

It offers many features for collaboration like sending links where non tech-savvy people can simple watch the design and give feedback without the hassle of installing an app or finding an exported image in their email inbox. 

The best thing is that it is free, so developers can install it, open the current, cloud synced file and copy color values or export assets. 

I had a few problems here since it does not play *that* nicely with SVGs or Icons and I think to make an asset exportable there is a little work involved. But other than that I only had good experiences with it.

### Invison

?? add logo

Invision App is the first tool I came across where you could upload your screen design from Sketch or Photoshop, then send a link to anyone and discuss or demo your project.

While the idea was great at that time, I really found it a bit complicated to use as a developer, also there was the constant need for the designer to re-upload their work after changes, hardly any way to export and so on.

After researching them again I noticed they introduced their own screen design app called [InVision Studio](https://www.invisionapp.com/studio) to be not bound to these limitations. 

This app seems to be fairly full featured, but you'll need a subscription plan to use it with more than one project.

Their discussion tools work really well though, you can try them out for free.

### Sketch Cloud

For quite some time Sketch seemed to be the big competitor for Adobe products and was even announced as "Photoshop Killer". 

While I liked to use it in the beginning, and I am sure the App itself is still awesome I am not so happy with their pricing model.

(??? add pricing image)

They did [announce](https://www.sketch.com/docs/sketch-cloud/) a cloud solution recently, and I had to use it from a developer perspective last year.
 
I got send a link where the design could be looked at online, but I must say I was not really happy with it. Exporting assets felt too complicated, and I did not find a way to copy color codes. Maybe I was just not smart enough, in this case I'll apologize.

In addition to that, sketch is quite pricey if you want updates (you can't open new files otherwise). 

Not the best solution to improve your team's productivity I think, still a good App though.

### Other tools

There are so many other awesome tools that often do serve the purpose of wire framing or brainstorming.
 
Some of them seem intentionally created to be a little less colorful and can serve your needs quite well. I tried [moqups.com/](https://moqups.com/) and was quite happy, but there are [many others](https://www.google.com/search?q=online+wireframe+tool) with different pricing models and capabilities. 

## Why Figma stole my heart

I purposfully omitted Figma in the list above because I wanted to talk a little more in depth 

Looking at it through the lense of  

- How well can non-technical people access the Design and give feedback
- How similar are the tools to what the Designer is used to, great switching cost
- How can you share these files? can the client or develoepr open them for exports? 

- Ease of use
- Perf (browser)
- copy paste
- FREE
- Features
- Humor, Social Media and community: show tweet 

comments a little discrating
Designer has to learn something new

## Bottom line

Use these tools, they are free, the benefits are immense!

Our guild has a unique way of looking at workflows, and we tend to get itchy a little faster when we see constant repetition. So why don't add your perspective in the next team meeting
