title: Testing Vue in Laravel with Jest - let's make it a little more easy
release_date: Today
slug: vue-testing-in-laravel
excerpt: >-

    Laravel offers an awesome testing environment for php, but if use Vue.js for much of your frontend, you most likely have big blindspot if you don't test that too.
    
    I try to ease the initial setup of testing Vue components in a dafault Laravel 6-8 Application.

Okay, let's admit it: Testing Laravel itself is an outright joy, but setting up tests for Vue.js components in your frontend is still quite a fight. Laravel can't provide an out-of-the-box solution, so you need to Google-Dive and assemble your own Frankenstein's Assertion Webpack Babel Monster. 

JavaScript and NPM packages change all the time, so most blogposts and tutorials are likely out of date (like this one, I greet you, future person ðŸ‘‹).

I still hope to help with my "currently working 2020 Laravel 8.x solution" here.
  
I also wrote and will show you a little package making setting everything up a cinch. Maybe this will still work at the time you are reading this. Why? Because:

> If it's hard to set up tests, nobody will write them
 

## TLDR

In a hurry? Just do this and try your luck! ðŸ¤ž

```bash

npm install -â€”save-dev jest vue-jest @vue/test-utils babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/preset-env

npx vue-tests-laravel-setup

```

## Let's start... why Jest?

There are essentially two test runners that are recommended by the **toodo vue docs**: Mocha and Jest. Since I also work with React I like Jest a lot. There is a lot already build in and that's less to worry about, right?

<sidenote heading="Maybe I'm too stupid for Mocha">

To admit it was also really hard for me to just get up and running with mocha and mocha webpack. There is a good **todo link laracasts video series** about the setup, but nothing seem to work with newer version of Laravel Mix.

In theory, you could just use your existing Webpack configuration generated by Laravel Mix, but in practice this turned out to be configuration nightmare. 

Smarter people might have made it work though (add link **todo**)

## Just npm install 300 packages



 

- how to set up jest and make it work
- First roadblock: Polyfills, rendering
- Second roadblock: Plugins
- Third roadbloack: Global functions
- fourth roadbloack: 
- fiths roadbloack: event emitters

summary, test as early as possible
