title: Testing Vue in Laravel with Jest - let's make it a little more easy
release_date: Today
slug: vue-testing-in-laravel
excerpt: >-

    Laravel offers an awesome testing environment for php, but if use Vue.js for much of your frontend, you most likely have big blindspot if you don't test that too.
    
    I try to ease the initial setup of testing Vue components in a dafault Laravel 6-8 Application.

Okay, let's admit it: Testing Laravel itself is an outright joy, but setting up tests for Vue.js components in your frontend is still quite a fight. Laravel can't provide an out-of-the-box solution, so you need to Google-Dive and assemble your own Frankenstein's Assertion Webpack Babel Monster. 

JavaScript and NPM packages change all the time, so most blogposts and tutorials are likely out of date (like this one, I greet you, future person ðŸ‘‹).

I still hope to help with my "currently working 2020 Laravel 8.x solution" here.
  
I also wrote and will show you a little package making setting everything up a cinch. Maybe this will still work at the time you are reading this. Why? Because:

> If it's hard to set up tests, nobody will write them
 

## TLDR

In a hurry? Just do this and try your luck! ðŸ¤ž

```bash

npm install -â€”save-dev jest vue-jest @vue/test-utils babel-core@^7.0.0-bridge.0 @babel/preset-env

npx vue-tests-laravel-setup

```

## Let's start: Laravel and Vue Versions

I could only test this tutorial with newer versions of Laravel, starting from 6.x, but it should still work with a **fresh install** of 5.6.

Currently this article is only talking about Vue 2.x, but the created npm package will try to detect your installed vue version and make changes accordingly.

I of course can't know all the ways you configured your already running projects. If you encounter an error and you think a solution would help a lot of people let's [figure something out together](mailto:info@simonvomeyser.de) and get more people into testing Vue in Laravel :) 

## ...and why use Jest and not Mocha?

There are essentially two test runners that are recommended by the **toodo vue docs**: Mocha and Jest. Since I also work with React I like Jest a lot. Since there is a lot already build in that's one thing less to worry about, right?

<sidenote heading="Maybe I'm too stupid for Mocha">

To admit it was also really hard for me to just get up and running with mocha and mocha webpack. There is a good **todo link laracasts video series** about the setup, but nothing seem to work with newer version of Laravel Mix.

In theory, you could just use your existing Webpack configuration generated by Laravel Mix, but in practice this turned out to be configuration nightmare. 

Smarter people might have made it work though (add link **todo**)

</sidenote>
 

## Okay, just install these 500 NPM packages

Most tutorials of this kind just throw a lot of `npm install` statements at you - and there is good reason for it. Explaining what all new packages do is cumbersome, and most people don't have the time to read an in depth explanation anyways.
 
If you "just want to make the damn thing work" I understand, we can still be friends: Take look at the <tldr-link>summary</tldr-link>.

I will try to cover at least a little more nerdy details here, but the **todo link package I created** already does everything for you.
 
### We need the basics

Let's start simple, we will need `jest` as our testrunner, 


- We need jest + vue test utils
- We need vue + template compiler, don't forget that
- Talk about single file components
- Jest config??


- Getting special
    - It is hard to compile
    - Vue jest needs babel needs babel jest, needs babel config
    
- Example files
- Example project

- What the package will do
- Summary
