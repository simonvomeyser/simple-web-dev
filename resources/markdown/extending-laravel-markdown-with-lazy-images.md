@todo taylor as captain america

Laravel makes use of a lot of powerful third party libraries and assembles them into a badass unit like Captain America does with the Avengers. 

Parts of the Symphony Framework provide solid low level functionality and testing is entrusted to the awesome folks at PHPUnit.

I found that Laravel also ships with a really powerful library for Markdown parsing called [commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) and wanted to make use of that implementing this blog.

I will go over using and customizing this library, something I found a little confusing at first. I will also show how to implement an extension by adding lazy loaded images to my posts, a feature all blogs should have - me in particular since I use way too many childish GIFs.

@todo Add childish gif

## Using it

By the time of writing, Laravel uses its internal Markdown parser for one purpose only: To make [Markdown Mailables](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/mail#markdown-mailables) possible. 

These Mailables are a weird mix of Blade and Markdown syntax - the Blade template is rendered by the class `\Illuminate\Mail\Markdown` making heavy use of the [sections and slots](@todo). 

@todo maybe add a gif "oh it's so pretty ugly child gif"

Hidden inside of these blade sections there are direct calls to the function we are looking for:

```php

// Will render Markdown, this creates "<h1>Hello</h1>
echo \Illuminate\Mail\Markdown::parse('# Hello');

```

With this static method we can already use the internal Markdown parser for our own markdown files:

```php

use Illuminate\Mail\Markdown;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\File;

$html = Markdown::parse(File::get('file.md'));

```

Now that's pretty üòç - but we are bound to the configuration Laravel dictates, so let's not stop here.
 
## Configuring it

The Markdown class is specialized in rendering mails for Laravel, so why toy with it?

<sidenote heading="On expandability">

The `Illuminate\Mail\Markdown` class is not bound to the service container or hidden behind an Interface. For Laravel there is no sense in offering a sophisticated abstraction if the functionality is only used in one place.

In relying on the concrete library our code will break if the Laravel core team decides to switch the underlying markdown library. For now this is the most approachable solution though, just be wary of for this.

</sidenote>

The most comfortable way I found is to customize the underlying [league/commonmark](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark) implementation is to use it like Laravel does it:

```php

$environment = Environment::createCommonMarkEnvironment();

$environment->addExtension(new TableExtension);

$converter = new CommonMarkConverter([
    'allow_unsafe_links' => false,
], $environment);

$html = $converter->convertToHtml('Your Markdown String');

```

Here we can already see how to customize the environment to our heart's liking with the possibilities the [underlying library provides](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/1.4/customization/overview/).

You can already see things that Laravel does:

- Adding a table Extension to provide the table component described in the [docs](https://laravel.com/docs/7.x/mail)
- Defaulting to not allow unsafe links, a precaution to prevent potential exploits, and the whole reason the markdown renderer was [changed](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/30982) in Laravel 6.x

You can do many more things from here without even diving into depth, just a few examples of things I added to render the posts of this page:

@todo maybe add images?

- Adding the [External Link Extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/1.4/extensions/external-links/) to have almost all links open in new windows, except the ones pointing to the same site
- Adding the [Heading Permalinks Extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/1.4/extensions/heading-permalinks/) to be able to link directly to headings 

Nearly everything can be achieved fairly quickly with the tools we already have on board, but what can you do when there is not extension available for the functionality you want?

## Extend it!

I wanted to add lazy images to my posts since it is a [common best practice](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/guides/lazy-loading) - but I did not find an extension for it.

**The TL;DR is**: When you are looking for exactly that functionality you can [download my extension](https://github.com/simonvomeyser/commonmark-ext-lazy-image/) - If you want to see how I did it and maybe want to create your own functionality keep on reading :)

### Diving in

If you are used coding in Laravel the `League\CommonMark` library feels a bit *old school* . It confused me at first that I needed to create an environment, add the extensions to this environment, then add the environment to the parser... and then add config for the extensions to the parser, not the environment. 
 
I don't mean to make a derogatory comment here though - the library is insanely flexible the authors and maintainers did awesome work. You can extend almost everything, listen for events and even access the generated data structure (AST) before it is rendered to HTML.

@todo side note wtf is a AST
 
The library features the possibility to add *parsers* and *renderes* on the created environment. Parsing means "recognizing a pattern in markdown and add it to the things that should be rendered". Rendering happens after the parsing is complete and means actually transforming the data (AST) into an HTML string.

@todo what meme

It gets even a little more confusing since the library distinguishes between *inline* and *block* handling, both have respective *parsers* and *renderes*. 

@todo talk about how you could go into depth

If you need to really parse new syntax like transforming twitter handles into links to the person's profile, there is [a tutorial](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/1.3/customization/inline-parsing/#inline-parser-examples) for that.

I will stop here since I found a better way to achieve my goal with lazy images.

But what we want to do is *extending* an already parsed 'inline' element, an image, with classes and attributes to make it lazy.

### Creating our Extension

Most of the core extensions work in quite a similar, straightforward way: They don't add parsers or renderers, they just listen for the `DocumentParsedEvent` and traverse the already created data structure to add a few things. 

The [External Links Extension](https://commonmark.thephpleague.com/1.3/extensions/external-links/) adds things like `target="_blank"` for example.

I ran into a problem with this approach since I wanted my lazy image extension to not only add things like an `loading="lazy"` attribute, something that hopefully will be sufficient [in the future](https://web.dev/native-lazy-loading/). I wanted to support the [various lazy loading libraries](https://www.cssscript.com/top-10-lazy-loading-javascript-libraries/) out there with configuration options.

Sadly, the really important work like checking for secure URLs is not done in the parser, it's done in the renderer, right before the image data get's turned into HTML. I had no access or possibility to empty the `src` attribute, something vital for most lazy loading libraries.

I found out it is possible to simply copy the content of the `League\CommonMark\Inline\Renderer\ImageRenderer`, adding my own functionality and adding this new renderer with a higher priority

```php

$environment->addInlineRenderer( 
    'League\CommonMark\Inline\Element\Image', 
    new LazyImageRenderer(),
    9000 // Priority, original is 0, we need to go higher, 10 ... or over 9000!
);

``` 

That might be a quick and dirty solution, but I think this is no way to live your life. The native `ImageRenderer` might change in the future, receive security updates and people using our extension would not benefit from those. 

I needed the processing inside the native image renderer to run and then run our functionality. I thought of simply extending the class, but the library authors declared almost all classes as final - something I saw many discussions about, but it was the first time it affected me.

@todo end add screenshot of taylor classes final 

I still have no strong final (eheh) opinion about this, but in this case it would have been helpful and made sense in my naive understanding. This is also has been discussed in the [issues](https://github.com/thephpleague/commonmark/issues/379) and I get the argument and respect the package author's decision though.

I ended up not subclassing but calling the original renderer and modifying the output in a composition over inheritance approach. To be a bit more concise: My own class just creates the core image renderer, gets it's output and changes it. Then you just tell the library to use your renderer instead of the original one, like in the first naive example.

The actual *programming* that needed to be done after that was quite simple in the end, but that is the whole reason I wanted to write this post. Usually the implementation of a feature is way less complicated than wrapping your head around the way a library wants to be extended and finding a way to start.

```php

// create the HTML Element for the original image
$baseImage = $this->baseImageRenderer->render($inline, $htmlRenderer);

// Provide modern browser lazy loading
$baseImage->setAttribute('loading', 'lazy');
// Set the data-src to the src that respects 'allow_unsafe_links' config
$baseImage->setAttribute('data-src', $baseImage->getAttribute('src'));
// Empty the original src
$baseImage->setAttribute('src', ''); 

return $baseImage;

``` 

I just added a few customizations that you can look up in the [documentation](@todo) of the package I created. In essence, you just read from the config here to make the class that get's added to the image customizable, and also the name of the `data` attribute. 

The [code](@todo) should be fairly easy to understand now :)


## Closing

Extending and tailoring the library to your needs is fairly straightforward once you got your feet off the ground. I even found an approach to not only tag on things but to alter the behaviour of the core with the lazy image extension, even if I was a little confused by the API at first. That might only be a matter of taste though, I know quite a few developers who prefer a more expressive setup instead of the hidden complexity style Laravel made popular.

I hope this little exploration helps someone out there trying to extend Laravel's and therefore the `commonmark` package's functionality!
