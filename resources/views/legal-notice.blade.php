        <h2>Liability for links</h2>
        <p>
            This website contains links to external third-party websites, over the content of which I have no control.
            I cannot, therefore, make any guarantees regarding this third-party content.
            Responsibility for the content of linked sites lies solely with the provider or operator of the site concerned.
            All linked sites were checked for possible violations of the law when they were linked to mine.
            At that time I was not aware of any content which may violate the law. However, I cannot be expected to monitor the content of linked sites on an ongoing basis unless I have reason to suspect a violation of the law.
            On becoming aware of such a violation I shall remove the respective link immediately
        </p>
